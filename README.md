# NeuralC
A simple c++ implementation of Neural Networks and optimization algorithms.

## Usage
It is very easy to setup a network using this API, you just need to `#include "NeuralCore/Network.h"`.

## Files
All files are in the `Neuralcore/ directory`, the main ones are:
### NeuralMath.h
Includes all functions and derivatives.
### Network.h
The main file, has the Network class.
### Optimization.h
Here you get the Gradient Descent algorith.
